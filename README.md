# Word-Guess-Game
This homework was very challenging for me as I haven't played with JS before.
Through the middle/end of the week, I realized I was wasting my efforts as none of the things I tried were working. I searched in google for many examples, but the vast majority included additions that I either did not understand or that we have not gone through yet.
In lieu of the deadline of this homework, and the fact that it's important to build a solid js ground, I have decided to sacrifice the quality of my homework to dedicate more time to studying JS from scratch. 
I understand that this is exactly the purpose of this homework, however, this assigment is far beyond my current skills.
